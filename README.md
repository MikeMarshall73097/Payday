# Payday
<div>By: Michael Marshall and Matt Kump</div>
In this chaser game, you are a robber who just escaped jail seeking to steal as much money from the bank as possible before the cops catch you. Careful, as you steal more money, more cops will come for you. Load up your weapon in the armory to release a special attack and remember to use your citizen decoy when you're in trouble. Good luck and happy payday...
